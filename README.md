# Heart Disease Analysis Project

## Overview

The Heart Disease Analysis project is designed to analyze and predict heart diseases using Java. This project encompasses various stages including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and machine learning model deployment.



## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Manages data cleaning, normalization, and feature extraction.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Provides insights into the dataset using statistical and graphical methods.
- **Visualization:** Displays data and results using various charts and plots.
- **Machine Learning:** Trains and evaluates models to predict heart disease outcomes.
- **Model Deployment:** Deploys the trained models for real-world predictions.

## Technologies Used

- Java
- Apache POI (for data handling, if applicable)
- Libraries for machine learning and visualization (e.g., Weka, JFreeChart)
- Maven (for project management)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- JDK 21 or later
- Maven
